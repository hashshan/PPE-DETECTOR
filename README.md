# PPE-DETECTOR
Real-time PPE Detection Model using Python , Yolov11n ,Flask , CVAT

 The primary objective of this project 
is to automate the detection of PPE 
compliance in industrial 
environments using a YOLOv11n
based machine learning model.
 
 This project aims to create a cost
effective, efficient, and scalable 
solution that promotes safer 
workplaces and supports industrial 
development.

 Key Goals:
 
 • Ensure Worker Safety: Identify if workers are wearing 
mandatory PPE such as helmets, gloves, safety vests, 
etc., in real-time.

 • Reduce Human Error: Minimize the need for manual 
inspections, which can be prone to oversight.
 
 • Enable Real-Time Monitoring: Provide instant alerts 
when safety protocols are violated.

 • Improve Compliance: Ensure adherence to 
regulatory safety standards with minimal effort.

 • Increase Productivity: Prevent accidents and 
downtime, ensuring smooth industrial operations.

 • Scalable and Flexible: Design a solution that can be 
adapted to different industries and PPE 
requirements
